0.  GIF supports 256 colors, all others 3 formats can support 16777216 (2^24) colors.
1.  Only GIF file format supports animation (from the given list of formats).
2.  Lossy compression encodes data by discarding some portions of it, so the original file is lost. Lossless compression preserves the original data.
3.  JPEG is the only lossy-compressed file format (from the given list of formats).
4.  When a file is deleted on a FAT file system, it's data is never lost - the file system only renames the file, and marks its clusters as free ones.
5.  The most optimal ways are to download a free file sanitizer, or to use a linux "dd" command.
6.  stdint.h is a header file of a standard C library, which defines several integer datatypes and some macros.
7.  These datatype are fixed-length - that means on every architecture their size is equal - which is essential for portability of programs reading and writing structures (like copy.c)
8.  BYTE is 1 byte, WORD is 2 bytes, DWORD and LONG are 4 bytes.
9.  In ASCII - "BM".
10. bfSize specifies the size of a whole bitmap file; biSize specifies only the size of a BITMAPINFOHEADER structure.
11. It means that a bmp file has its rows stored in top-down order. Actual height is then abs(biHeight).
12. A field called biBitCount.
13. For example, there is no more free space in a filesystem to create a file; or the user doesn't have permissions to create it.
14. Third argument to fread specifies the number of reads from a stream; we need only one reading of a structure at a time.
15. 3 bytes of padding.
16. fseek() alters the current position in an opened file - for example, it can shift position to beginning, end, or two bytes away from current position.
17. SEEK_CUR is a constant value defined in stdio.h, and is an argument to fseek() - it means "Seek from the current location" of an opened file.
